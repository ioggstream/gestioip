+++ Net::Ping::External Perl Module ignores timeout option +++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++


GestioIP's automatic actualization of networks as well as the
"host check" function works with the Perl Module Net::Ping::External.
Because Net::Ping::External doesn't accept timeout argument under
Linux, it works with the default timeout of 10s.

With a small modification in the source-code of the file External.pm
you can fix this problem and make automatic actualization even more
faster.

The ping version of most actual Linux distributions uses the
-W option to specify ping timeout


Patch Net::Ping::External:

* Consult "ping" man page to check if ping supports -W argument:

   $ man ping

(If your ping implementation uses another argument than -W use the
other argument instead)


* find Perl Module External.pm:

   $ perl -MFile::Find=find -MFile::Spec::Functions -lwe 'find { wanted => sub { print canonpath $_ if /\.pm\z/ }, no_chdir => 1 }, @INC' | grep External.pm


* open External.pm with your favorite editor and find the line

   sub _ping_linux {

some lines later you find the line

   $command = "ping -c $args{count} $args{host}"

to fix the timeout problem add the -W argument to the line

   $command = "ping -c $args{count} -W $args{timeout} $args{host}";


save and close the file External.pm



That's it! Automatic actualization and host check will now work with a
timeout of 2 seconds.
